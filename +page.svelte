  <h1>Final Project Prototype</h1>
  <p>For our Final Project, we wanted to talk about the Central Limit Thereom. The Central Limit Theorem is a concept in statistics that describes the behavior of the sum or average of a 
    large number of independent, identically distributed randome variables. The theoram states that, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, the distribution of
    the sample means will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is sufficiently large. To show this, we are using the Iris dataset from the UCI machine learning repository
    which has a shape of 150 rows and 4 columns. 
  </p>
  <App />
  <p> We can see that the Central Limit Thereom is able to be applied to many types of datasets and at the end would create a curve similar to the bell curve.
